/**
 * Ensure that a user is logged in before proceeding to next route middleware.
 *
 * This middleware ensures that a user is logged in.  If a request is received
 * that is unauthenticated, the request will be redirected to a login page (by
 * default to `/login`).
 *
 * Additionally, `returnTo` will be be set in the session to the URL of the
 * current request.  After authentication, this value can be used to redirect
 * the user to the page that was originally requested.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *     app.get('/profile',
 *       ensureLoggedIn(),
 *       function(req, res) { ... });
 *
 *     app.get('/profile',
 *       ensureLoggedIn('/signin'),
 *       function(req, res) { ... });
 *
 *     app.get('/profile',
 *       ensureLoggedIn({ redirectTo: '/session/new', setReturnTo: false }),
 *       function(req, res) { ... });

 * Ensure that no user is logged in before proceeding to next route middleware.
 *
